Years of working across diverse products and teams sharpened my ability to navigate complexity and focus deeply where decisions carry weight. <strong class="text-ink dark:text-neutral-100">Web Performance at scale</strong> is one area where that focus consistently pays off — I&#39;ve led initiatives that took Core Web Vitals from failing to passing in months, turning performance from a dashboard metric into a real business lever. </p><p> Technical leadership came naturally alongside hands-on engineering. I lead by example — through architecture discussions, code reviews, and mentoring — helping teams cut through trade-offs and ship better products with confidence. </p><p> Outside of tech, I&#39;m deeply involved in the underground electronic music scene as a DJ and resident DJ at <strong class="text-ink dark:text-neutral-100">Obra</strong>, a music collective and party understood as a continuous process rather than a fixed event. Obra treats music and the dancefloor as cultural systems — shaped by curation, deep listening, and context — not as commodities. </p><p> Both in engineering and in music, the same principles drive me: <strong class="text-ink dark:text-neutral-100">structure with flexibility, depth without elitism, and the belief that meaningful work emerges from process, collaboration, and constant reconstruction.</strong></p></div>',2)])]))}});export{h as default};
