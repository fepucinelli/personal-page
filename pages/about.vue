        — the kind where engineering decisions ripple through scalability, performance, and long-term business outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work at the intersection of technical depth and strategic thinking, designing systems meant to outlast the sprint they were built in. Years of working across diverse products and teams sharpened my ability to navigate complexity and focus deeply where decisions carry weight.
        <strong class="text-ink dark:text-neutral-100">Web Performance at scale</strong> is one area where that focus consistently pays off — I've led initiatives that took Core Web Vitals from failing to passing in months, turning performance from a dashboard metric into a real business lever.
      </p>

      <p>
        Technical leadership came naturally alongside hands-on engineering. I lead by example — through architecture discussions, code reviews, and mentoring — helping teams cut through trade-offs and ship better products with confidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of tech, I'm deeply involved in the underground electronic music scene as a DJ and resident DJ at
        <strong class="text-ink dark:text-neutral-100">Obra</strong>, a music collective and party understood as a continuous process rather than a fixed event. Obra treats music and the dancefloor as cultural systems — shaped by curation, deep listening, and context — not as commodities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both in engineering and in music, the same principles drive me:
        <strong class="text-ink dark:text-neutral-100">structure with flexibility, depth without elitism, and the belief that meaningful work emerges from process, collaboration, and constant reconstruction.</strong>
